# Chapter 1: Storing the new flavors
# Let's create lists to store the results of how three new yogurt flavors were rated in a consumer product test.
# To store the new yogurt flavors, create an empty list called flavors.
# Code the elements "cinnamon", followed by "pumpkin", and finally "apple pie".
flavors = ['cinnamon', 'pumpkin', 'apple pie']
# Display the new flavors starting with a "New flavors:" label.
print('New flavors: ')
# Finish displaying the list by coding a display statement with flavors between parentheses.
print(flavors)
# Chapter 2: Storing ratings and results
# With the list of new yogurt flavors in place, we'll use lists to store the consumer ratings and final results.
# To hold the rating consumers gave to each flavor, code an empty ratings list.
# Inside the list, code 4 for cinnamon, then 2.5 for pumpkin, and finally 3 for apple pie.
ratings = [4, 2.5, 3]
# Display the ratings with the label "Consumer ratings:" on the first line, and the list ratings on the next.
print('Consumer ratings: ')
print(ratings)
# To store the results of whether the flavors have passed the consumer test, code the empty list passed.
# With a rating of 4, the cinnamon yogurt passed, so code True.
# Then add False followed by True for the other two flavors.
passed = [True, False, True]
# Finally, display the results starting with "Release:" on the first line, and then the list passed on the next.
print('Release: ')
print(passed)
# You did great! You helped manage a consumer test by using lists to store the new flavors,
# as well as the ratings and results.
