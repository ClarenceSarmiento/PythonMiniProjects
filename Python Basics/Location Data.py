# This Project is called Location Data
# Let's use variables to record data points about a traveler's location as part of a journaling app.
# We'll start by creating a descriptive variable name to store which country the traveler is located in.
# Let's create a variable name "country" and give it a string value 'USA'.
country = 'USA'
# Let's track the state the traveler is located in, by creating a state variable with the value "Florida".
state = 'Florida'
# Now let's another variable name 'city' and give it a string value 'Miami'.
city = 'Miami'
# Create the continent variable and give it the value 'North America'.
continent = 'North America'
# Nice! We've stored the location data inside the country, state, city,
# and continent variables. Now the travel journal is up to date.
